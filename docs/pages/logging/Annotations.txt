Annotations
Annotations, especially custom ones, are an obscure facet of java. However, they are very useful for marking code, and for Logging, all we need to do is mark certain code.
Java has a few built in annotations that illustrate this point:
@Deprecated //To say if a class should be used or not (Kinda like a warning sign)
public class AnnotationSample {
    @Override //Override a method in the superclass
    public String toString(){
        return "hello world";
    }
    @
}
Annotations have a type and parameters:
@SuppressWarnings(value="unused")
In this case, the "@SuppressWarnings" is the type, and "value" is the parameter.
NOTE: in Java, if the annotation has one parameter called value like the above, you can avoid the call to value= and just put the thing you are passing
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
