## TechnoLib

TechnoLib is a FTC Library for everyone:
 - WPILib inspired command structure
 - Tons of simple implementations to provide abstractions, and teach you the basics
 - EOCV integration for vision
 - RoadRunner integration for pathfollowing
 - Annotation based Telemetry
 - And much much more

**The goal of this library is stated as follows**
 The goal of TechnoLib is not only to provide versatile resources that assist in software development and strengthen code structure, but to also abstract out redundancy.
 
## Installation
But if this library is so good, it must be hard to install right? wrong:
 - Add this to the repositories{} block in TeamCode/build.gradle: 
   ```maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }```
 - And add this to the dependencies block in TeamCode/build.gradle: 
   ```implementation 'com.github.technototes:TechnoLib:1.0.0'```    
   **(replace 1.0.0 with the latest release if it isnt already)**
 - Build the code and you are good to go
 
## Ease of Use
But if this library is so powerful, won't it be hard to use?
Nope, in fact its easier than without the library
 - Complex subsystems have already been written for you
 - Plenty of simple things to make your life easier
 - Test implementation so you can see how to make this work
 - ETC.
