# Notes for Kevin

(I'm the software mentor, picking up ownership of TechnLib from Alex Stedman, the original author)

## Hardware details to keep in mind

The analog sticks are vertically inverted: When you push the stick up/away, the Y value decreases.

The shoulder triggers' range is from 0 to 1, not -1 to 1.

I'm not currently sure what orientation the SDK 8.1+ IMU calls 0 degrees.
